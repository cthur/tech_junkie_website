		<h3>Smart Fridge</h3>
		<p>A fridge of the future that tells you what to cook with your left-overs and automatically re-orders fresh food is being designed in the UK.
		The self-cleaning 'fridge of the future' will automatically place supermarket home delivery orders when required and move food near its use by date to the front of the shelves.
		Researchers hope the fridge could clean itself, cut down on wasted food and offer up recipes - which could be tailored to different countries, 
		cuisines and seasons depending on whether people want to whip up something Italian or fancy a curry.
		</p>
		<p>The planned new features include the ability for fridges to scan their shelves to see what is in stock and use this information to both plan meals and automatically place a 
		supermarket food order - with Ocado saying they could be hooked up to their website making grocery requests even simpler.
		The smart fridge will use 'nano-articulated technology' shelf surfaces which, whilst smooth to the touch, will have millions of independently controlled micro-tiles which will 
		manoeuvre products which soon need to be eaten to the front of the fridge.
		The fridge will also monitor gases released by degrading foods and push these to the front of its shelves, according to the collaborators.
		Ultrasound-scanning technology built into the door will allow the fridge to 'swipe and capture' the food on a plate before and after mealtime, meaning it can assess what type and amount of food is wasted.
