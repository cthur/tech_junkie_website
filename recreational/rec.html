		<h3><a href="projected.html">The Future of Computer Peripherals</a></h3> 
		<p class="mainPara">Futurists, computer scientists, and trendsetting analysts all agree – the personal computer, particularly in its current configuration, 
		probably won’t be with us too much longer. And we understand the reasoning. The PC is a space hog in a world where space is increasingly at a premium, 
		it's an energy hog at a time when energy is both costly and precious, and it's no longer the driver of the technology industry it once was. That honor 
		now goes to all those nifty little pads and pods and tabs we suddenly can't seem to live without. The long-in-the-tooth desktop, meanwhile, has already 
		been relegated by some to dinosaur status.		
		</p>
		<p class="mainPara">Yet as much as it's been beaten down, as much as its fate seems sealed by a world that now craves mobility and a technological revolution that's 
		now revolving in other directions, the PC isn't going anywhere anytime soon. It remains the workhorse of the workforce, the finest tool in the 
		arsenal for visual arts, and the panacea for non-console gamers everywhere.

		<h3><a href="poster.html">The Future of Televisions</a></h3> 
		<p class="mainPara">The future of television is much more than social; much in the same way that the future of media is too, more than social. Social 
		is a fabric; it connects the individual nodes that make up the human network. But, social however, is not a means to an end. And, as such, the same is 
		true about the working theories driving Social TV. Understanding the role social plays in how viewers connect with programs and other people is essential 
		to defining the future of television.
		</p>
		<p class="mainPara">This is a time when bringing to life what’s possible takes imagination, design, scripting, and innovation. We need to raise the bar. The future of TV 
		won’t be driven by a social media strategy. Instead, the future of TV will be driven by innovation and a vision for more meaningful entertainment 
		and engagement (no it won’t be called entergagement). This innovation will in turn inspire new programming, revenue opportunities and ultimately social media strategies.

		<h3><a href="glasses.html">The Future of Gaming</a></h3> 
		<p class="mainPara">HTML 5 and Mobile are the future of gaming. There, we said it! In 2012, we are in the middle of a confluence of change. Desktop and laptop PCs are 
		being supplanted by ever-more-powerful handheld tablets and phones. Gaming consoles that ruled the market as recently as 3 years ago are seeing a staggering drop off in 
		sales, as are dedicated console games themselves. 
		</p>
		<p class="mainPara">But people are still playing games, where are they playing? They are playing them online, and increasingly they are playing them on mobile devices. 
		But there are a lot of different mobile devices - feature phones, smartphones, tablets, from different manufacturers, and using different operating systems. How can a 
		developer create a game for each platform? They can't. A single, unifying technology that operates the same on all devices is needed. That is what HTML 5 presents.
