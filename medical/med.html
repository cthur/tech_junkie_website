		<h3><a href="surgery.html">The Future of Surgery</a></h3>
		<p class="mainPara">TEDMED just released a fascinating talk about color-coded surgery by Dr. Quyen Nguyen, a 
		surgeon at the University of California San Diego. We’ve recently covered some pivotal developments in Nature 
		Medicine and Science Translational Medicine that describe the use of fluorescent probes to selectively 
		illuminate cancer cells during surgery. Those projects resulted from international collaborations 
		(The Netherlands, Germany, Indiana; Japan, Maryland), and Dr. Nguyen herself has been working with a team 
		including Nobel Laureate in Chemistry, Dr. Roger Tsien, so it is appropriate that she emphasizes in the talk 
		that “successful innovation is a team sport.” Interestingly, her group has also worked on illuminating nerves 
		so that surgeons are better able to avoid severing important connections. If the pace of this work continues, 
		it may not be too long before surgical fields look more like Gray’s Anatomy pictures.

		<h3><a href="nano.html">The Future of Nano Tech</a></h3>
		<p class="mainPara">Nanotechnology involves manipulating properties and structures at the nanoscale, often 
		involving dimensions that are just tiny fractions of the width of a human hair. Nanotechnology is already 
		being used in products in its passive form, such as cosmetics and sunscreens, and it is expected that in 
		the coming decades, new phases of products, such as better batteries and improved electronics equipment, 
		will be developed and have far-reaching implications.
		</p>
		<p class="mainPara">One area of nanotechnology application that holds the promise of providing great 
		benefits for society in the future is in the realm of medicine. Nanotechnology is already being used as 
		the basis for new, more effective drug delivery systems and is in early stage development as scaffolding in 
		nerve regeneration research. Moreover, the National Cancer Institute has created the Alliance for 
		Nanotechnology in Cancer in the hope that investments in this branch of nanomedicine could lead to breakthroughs 
		in terms of detecting, diagnosing, and treating various forms of cancer.

		<h3><a href="robots.html">The Future of Robots in the Medical Field</a></h3>
		<p class="mainPara">Robots like the da Vinci surgical robot have enabled humans to achieve a remarkable degree 
		of precision when performing certain surgeries, but these technologies – while incredible – are really just an 
		extension of a physician’s body, like a very high tech scalpel or forceps.
		</p>
		<p class="mainPara">A new generation of tiny snake-like robots is actually capable of crawling through 
		the body to perform surgery, but again, these are guided by a human physician, and tethered to a external machine.
