	<h2>Welcome</h2>

		<p>The future hold so many wonderful surprises. Thankfully, for those of us who do not like surprises we can 
		take a peak into what the future might have in store for us. Here at Tech Junkies, we are like kids in a candy store, 
		extremely excited with all the future tech news that comes out. That is why we created this website to share with everyone
		all the cool future tech that we come across.</p>
		<p>Technology is constantly changing and evolving at an extremely alarming pace. We have gone from computers that take up
		an entire room, to computers that allow us to use touch screens and accepts audio input, and even allows us to use gestures.
		To be considered to have even a reasonably good cell phone, it must have a touchscreen. This is just the world we live in now,
		buying the latest piece of tech, it is almost a given that something new will be released in 5 or 6 monthes that will be even
		better than the tech you bought. Some might think that is a bad thing, and it just might be, but for those who are into tech,
		it is fun to see how companies can top their last product. It is thrilling to read about concepts for future tech, and image how
		our lives can be made easier, and better, maybe lazier, but still better, by buying into that tech.
