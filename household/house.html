		<h3><a href="security.html">The Future of Household Security</a></h3> 
		<p class="mainPara">The future of home security is convenience. Recent technological developments have resulted in “smart” 
		systems that do much more than just sound an alarm when a sensor has been tripped. These new systems 
		are connected to your thermostat, appliances, smartphone and computer. Now you have the power to monitor 
		your home when you’re away.
		</p>
		<p class="mainPara">With full-home control, you can arm and disarm your security system with a smartphone app, or a key fob, 
		similar to what you would use to unlock your car. You can also conserve energy by changing the thermostat, 
		turning off appliances and switching off lights. 
		</p>
		<p class="mainPara">Imagine the peace of mind you’d gain if you had the ability to log in to a website at work or on the road 
		and arm your system, or check on the camera feeds to make sure everything is as you left it. It seems futuristic, 
		but this technology is available now. Some home security companies, like ADT, already offer full-home control 
		systems, with smartphone apps for iPhone and other mobile operating systems.

		<h3><a href="luxury.html">The Future of Household Luxuries</a></h3>
		<p class="mainPara">My home is not very smart. It does not know when to start my coffee or how to clean the floor. It has 
		difficulty distinguishing between a roaring grease fire and a steamy shower, which makes it a good thing 
		it can't remember the number to call in an emergency. The only interaction I have with the house is when I 
		must dance the Macarena in front of the motion detector to get my outside lights to come on.
		What will be in the smart home of the future?
